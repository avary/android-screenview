Uses the built in screencap functionality of Android and the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to grab and display a series of screenshots. Requires Android SDK installed and does not require a rooted device.

The speed of update has to do with the screen resolution and image complexity. Simple screens (text and controls) update about twice a second. More complex screens (pictures, graphics, etc.) are slower than that.

Also supports saving a PNG to file.
